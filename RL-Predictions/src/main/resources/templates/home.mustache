						Would you like to make RLCS's predictions? You can do this thanks to RLPredictions, what position will the EU and NA teams be in? And what about the players, 
						who will be the golden striker, the clutch playmaker and the savior of the season?
					</p>
					<p>
						Write down and save your predictions here, and when the season's over, you can see how many of them you got right. See what other people thought and,of course,
						compare it with your friends.
